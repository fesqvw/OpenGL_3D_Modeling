- figure out how I want to draw things
	-> how to define translation, rotations, and scaling
		-> depends on the vertices
- define and create shaders for : (Shape is just an abstracton, Edge is just a line)
	-> Vertices
	-> Triangles
- define draw methods for :
	-> Vertex : (selected or not)
	-> Edge : (vertex selected or not / selected or not)
	-> Triangle : (selected or not / shaded or not / wireframe or not)
	-> Shape : (draw everything with the needed parameters Vertex/Edge/Triangle : what is selected, shaded, wireframe)
- create camera class
- create window manager
